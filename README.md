About
Practice implementing a full-stack application that uses Django as a framework. This project includes two apps, a login/reg app and the Job Viewer app. Some tools used include Bcrypt for password management, HTML/CSS(Bootstrap) for front end, Python with Django for back end, with a SQLite database.
